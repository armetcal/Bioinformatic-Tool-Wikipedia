# Background

Metagenomic sequencing detects all DNA in the sample, regardless of kingdom.
While certain sample processing kits can reduce the amount of non-microbial DNA,
any **metagenomic sample from a human microbiome will contain some human reads**
(often quite a large proportion).

These reads can be recognized and removed by several available tools. The BBMap
suite, which was previously used to remove adapters, can also remove human reads
using the bbsplit tool.

**BBSplit takes each read and compares it to one or more reference genomes in
order to determine which one it matches best.** Here we can use a human
reference genome in order to determine whether each read is likely human or
other (i.e. microbial).

# Reference Genome

BBMap does not come with reference genomes, and so the representative human
genome must be downloaded. There are standardized human reference genomes
available online.

The most recent human reference genome can be found by searching the NCBI
database, where humans are classified as taxon #9606:
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/?taxon=9606>

The search results should show the most recent reference genome at the top of
the list. It should have a green check mark.
