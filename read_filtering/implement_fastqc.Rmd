# Check Read Quality With FastQC and MultiQC

FastQC is a desktop application that can be used to visually inspect the quality
of reads stored in fastq files. However, it can also be run via the command
line, where it outputs an HTML file with summary statistics.

The website can be found [here](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk);
however, it is pre-installed on Compute Canada and does not need to be
separately downloaded. The tool is very modifiable, so read the documentation if
any modifications are desired. The documentation also describes the
interpretation in detail.

However, the major downside of FastQC is that each output file must be
individually inspected. Instead, we can use MultiQC, which analyzes all files
and outputs a single HTML document, making it much more convenient for
high-throughput projects. This tool is not pre-installed on Compute Canada.

## Implementing FastQC

FastQC is designed to be run on fastq files. The implementation is very simple:
we simply load the FastQC module, make a list of all our fastq files, and then
feed them to the `fastqc` command.

--outdir will be used to save all of our fastqc outputs into a separate folder.

Update the module versions as needed - use `module spider FastQC` to see the
available versions.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=T, results='hide'}
# Create an output folder
mkdir FastQC
# Load FastQC and its dependencies - update versions as needed.
module load StdEnv/2023 fastqc/0.12.1
# Run FastQC on all forward read files
parallel fastqc --outdir=FastQC ::: *_1.fastq.gz
```

There are two outputs per fastq file: an HTML summary and a zipped file
containing all the plots in the HTML summary.

## Implementing MultiQC

MultiQC documentation can be found [here](https://multiqc.info/docs/).

Installation is simple. If you have Miniconda installed, you can use
`conda install multiqc`; otherwise, try `pip install multiqc`. Other options are
listed [here](https://multiqc.info/docs/getting_started/installation/).
Installation will take a long time.
